We need audio visual representations of the links that will be bound together in rings by cables. These rings will capture asteroids
that are spinning by matching their spin, then constricting around the aseroid. Trolleybots bearing rockets will then manuver to stop the spin and manuver the asteroid into a stable high earth orbit. This could be done in Blender. Blender is ideal because of its open source and free to use structure.
