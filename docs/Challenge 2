# Challenge 002: Coordinated Spool Control for a Continuous Cable Loop

**Problem:** How do we control N spools (e.g., 12 spools for 2 cables on 6 links) to uniformly tension or expand a continuous loop around an irregular object without causing slack, jams, or over-tension?

**Parameters:**
- Each spool has a VFD motor, encoder, and tension sensor.
- Spools communicate via a CAN bus network.
- The asteroid's shape is unknown pre-contact.

**Simulation Task:** Develop a simple control algorithm (in Python, MATLAB, etc.) that uses a "master tension" value and adjusts individual spool speeds to maintain it, simulating an irregular shape pushing on the net.
