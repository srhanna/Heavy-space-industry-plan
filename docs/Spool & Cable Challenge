# Challenge: Gen 1 Continuous Loop Cable System

## Objective
Design the spooling mechanism for a two-cable, continuous loop system on a Gen 1 link.

## Specifications & Open Questions
1.  **Cable:** ~115m length per loop, 5-10mm diameter. Exact material? (e.g., Dyneema, steel).
2.  **Spool:** Must fit within a 0.6m x 0.6m x 0.8m link chassis with other components. What are optimal dimensions?
3.  **Motor & Drive:** BLDC motor + planetary gearbox + rad-hard VFD. Required stall torque? Estimated mass/power?
4.  **Control:** How does the AI coordinate spools across all links to tighten/loosen the net without jams?

## Deliverable Ideas
*   A kinematic model (in any software) of the spooling mechanism.
*   A control algorithm pseudo-code for coordinated tensioning.
*   A Blender model of the integrated spool within a link.
