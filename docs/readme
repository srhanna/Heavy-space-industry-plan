# The Leverage Principle: An Accelerated Bootstrap Blueprint

**A practical, open-source project to build a spacefaring civilization, starting with planetary defense.**

Conceived by Stephan Ross Hanna.

## The Vision (The Accelerated Path)
We are engineering a **self-replicating industrial ecosystem** in space. Our strategy leverages a key insight: the first asteroids are not just for ore—they are **natural shields and pre-fabricated structures**.

**The Optimized Sequence:**
1.  **Gen 1 (The Sculptor):** A launched "seed" ring uses a **millimeter-wave drill** to hollow out small asteroids.
2.  **Gen 2 (The Hollowed Foundry):** These carved asteroids become vast, radiation-shielded workshops. Inside, robots build precision components in safety.
3.  **Gen 3 (The Orbital Metropolis):** Multiple Gen 2 nodes connect, forming a distributed factory network capable of large-scale construction and habitat creation.
4.  **Gen N (The Steward):** The system matures into a solar-system-wide industrial intelligence, capable of planetary defense, building world-ships, and securing abundance.

## Why This Approach?
It solves the hardest problem first: **the space environment**. By moving the delicate factory *inside* meters of asteroid rock from the very beginning, we bypass the extreme cost and difficulty of "hardening" tiny Earth-like machines for open space.
