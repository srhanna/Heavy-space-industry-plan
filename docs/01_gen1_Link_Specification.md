# Project Challenge 001: Gen 1 Seed Link Specification

## Objective
Define the minimal viable design for the first Earth-launched link.

## Core Requirements (Draft)
*   **Mass:** < 200 kg per link.
*   **Function:** Must connect mechanically to two identical links, forming a rigid segment.
*   **Deployment:** Must house a spool for the primary tension cable, which also acts as a trolley rail.
*   **Interface:** Must provide a standard power/data connection port for the network.
*   **Packaging:** Must stack efficiently with other links in a standard launch fairing (e.g., SpaceX Falcon 9, 4.6m diameter).

## Open Questions for Collaboration
1.  What is the optimal mechanical connection mechanism (e.g., bolted flange, self-latching clamp)?
2.  What should be the standard bus voltage for the inter-link power grid?
3.  What specific sensors should be included in the baseline model?
