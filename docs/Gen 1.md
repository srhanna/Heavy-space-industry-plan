# Gen 1 Challenge: The Sculptor Seed Specification

**Objective:** Define the minimal viable "Gen 1" system capable of capturing a small (~20m) asteroid and hollowing it to create a "Gen 2 Hollowed Foundry."

## Revised Mission Profile
Gen 1 is not a general-purpose factory. It is a **specialized sculptor**. Its success is measured by its ability to create a single product: a **hollowed, internally-prepared asteroid shell**.

## Core Requirements & Open Questions

### 1. The Ring & Mobility System
*   **Scale:** 6-8 links, forming a ring capable of encircling a ~20m target.
*   **Propulsion:** 2-4 rocket trolleys for primary attitude control.
*   **Cable System:** A 2-cable continuous loop system for spin-matching and constriction.
*   **Open Question:** What is the optimal balance between ring strength and launch mass?

### 2. Primary Tool Suite (The Heart of Gen 1)
*   **Millimeter-Wave (Gyrotron) Drill:** For creating sealed, smooth-walled cavities. This is the **enabling technology** for the accelerated path.
*   **Miniature Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM):** For bulk material excavation to feed initial processing.
*   **Open Question:** Should these tools be separate trolley heads, or a single, multi-function unit? What is the minimum viable power requirement for the gyrotron to be effective?

### 3. Power System
*   **Requirement:** Must support the enormous energy demand of the gyrotron drill.
*   **Strategy:** Deployment of **secondary solar arrays** is likely the first major task after asteroid capture, before serious excavation begins.
*   **Open Question:** Should Gen 1 carry pre-fabricated panel "wings," or a system to manufacture panels from processed asteroidal material (silicon)?

### 4. Initial Processing & Foundry Preparation
*   **Goal:** Convert TBM output into: 1) Basic structural elements for reinforcing the hollowed cavity, 2) Raw material for initial cable/rail production inside the asteroid.
*   **Open Question:** What is the absolute minimum set of processors (e.g., a crusher, an electrolysis unit for oxygen/metals) needed to bootstrap the internal Gen 2 workshop?

## Success Criteria for Gen 1
The Gen 1 mission is complete when:
1.  A target asteroid is captured and stabilized.
2.  A primary cavity of useful dimensions (e.g., 5m diameter, 10m deep) is excavated and sealed by the gyrotron drill.
